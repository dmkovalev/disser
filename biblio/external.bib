   abstract = {Abductive inference is an important AI reasoning technique to find explanations of observations, and has recently been applied to scientific discovery. To find best hypotheses among many logically possible hypotheses, we need to evaluate hypotheses obtained from the process of hypothesis generation. We propose an abductive inference architecture combined with an EM algorithm working on binary decision diagrams (BDDs). This work opens a way of applying BDDs to compress multiple hypotheses and to select most probable ones from them. An implemented system has been applied to inference of inhibition in metabolic pathways in the domain of systems biology.},

   abstract = {In this paper we use a logic-based representation and a combination of Abduction and Induction to model inhibition in metabolic networks. In general, the integration of abduction and induction is required when the following two conditions hold. Firstly, the given background knowledge is incomplete. Secondly, the problem must require the learning of general rules in the circumstance in which the hypothesis language is disjoint from the observation language. Both these conditions hold in the application considered in this paper. Inhibition is very important from the therapeutic point of view since many substances designed to be used as drugs can have an inhibitory effect on other enzymes. Any system able to predict the inhibitory effect of substances on the metabolic network would therefore be very useful in assessing the potential harmful side-effects of drugs. In modelling the phenomenon of inhibition in metabolic networks, background knowledge is used which describes the network topology and functional classes of inhibitors and enzymes. This background knowledge, which represents the present state of understanding, is incomplete. In order to overcome this incompleteness hypotheses are considered which consist of a mixture of specific inhibitions of enzymes (ground facts) together with general (non-ground) rules which predict classes of enzymes likely to be inhibited by the toxin. The foreground examples are derived from in vivo experiments involving NMR analysis of time-varying metabolite concentrations in rat urine following injections of toxins. The model's performance is evaluated on training and test sets randomly generated from a real metabolic network. It is shown that even in the case where the hypotheses are restricted to be ground, the predictive accuracy increases with the number of training examples and in all cases exceeds the default (majority class). Experimental results also suggest that when sufficient training data is provided, non-ground hypotheses show a better predictive accuracy than ground hypotheses. The model is also evaluated in terms of the biological insight that it provides.},

   abstract = {The reuse of scientific knowledge obtained from one investigation in another investigation is basic to the advance of science. Scientific investigations should therefore be recorded in ways that promote the reuse of the knowledge they generate. The use of logical formalisms to describe scientific knowledge has potential advantages in facilitating such reuse. Here, we propose a formal framework for using logical formalisms to promote reuse. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by using it in a worked example from biology: demonstrating cycles of investigation formalization [F] and reuse [R] to generate new knowledge.We first used logic to formally describe a Robot scientist investigation into yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) functional genomics [f1]. With Robot scientists, unlike human scientists, the production of comprehensive metadata about their investigations is a natural by-product of the way they work. We then demonstrated how this formalism enabled the reuse of the research in investigating yeast phenotypes [r1 = R(f1)]. This investigation found that the removal of non-essential enzymes generally resulted in enhanced growth. The phenotype investigation was then formally described using the same logical formalism as the functional genomics investigation [f2 = F(r1)]. We then demonstrated how this formalism enabled the reuse of the phenotype investigation to investigate yeast systems-biology modelling [r2 = R(f2)]. This investigation found that yeast flux-balance analysis models fail to predict the observed changes in growth. Finally, the systems biology investigation was formalized for reuse in future investigations [f3 = F(r 2)]. These cycles of reuse are a model for the general reuse of scientific knowledge. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {Disjunctive Logic Programming (DLP) is an advanced formalism for knowledge representation and reasoning, which is very expressive in a precise mathematical sense: it allows one to express every property of finite structures that is decidable in the complexity class ∑ 2p (NP NP). Thus, under widely believed assumptions, DLP is strictly more expressive than normal (disjunction-free) logic programming, whose expressiveness is limited to properties decidable in NP. Importantly, apart from enlarging the class of applications which can be encoded in the language, disjunction often allows for representing problems of lower complexity in a simpler and more natural fashion. This article presents the DLV system, which is widely considered the state-of-the-art implementation of disjunctive logic programming, and addresses several aspects. As for problem solving, we provide a formal definition of its kernel language, function-free disjunctive logic programs (also known as disjunctive datalog), extended by weak constraints, which are a powerful tool to express optimization problems. We then illustrate the usage of DLV as a tool for knowledge representation and reasoning, describing a new declarative programming methodology which allows one to encode complex problems (up to Δ 33-complete problems) in a declarative fashion. On the foundational side, we provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the language of DLV, and by deriving new complexity results we chart a complete picture of the complexity of this language and important fragments thereof. Furthermore, we illustrate the general architecture of the DLV system, which has been influenced by these results. As for applications, we overview application front-ends which have been developed on top of DLV to solve specific knowledge representation tasks, and we briefly describe the main international projects investigating the potential of the system for industrial exploitation. Finally, we report about thorough experimentation and benchmarking, which has been carried out to assess the efficiency of the system. The experimental results confirm the solidity of DLV and highlight its potential for emerging application areas like knowledge management and information integration. © 2006 ACM.},

The system builds upon existing ALP techniques but includes several optimisations and extensions necessitated by recent applications in computational biology, temporal reasoning and machine learning. Unlike some other ALP systems that support non-ground abduction through the integrated use of constraint solving, we adopt a more lightweight approach which avoids this complexity at the expense of only computing ground hypotheses. We argue our approach is suited to a wide class of real-world problems and demonstrate the effectiveness of \ProLogICA\ on three non-trivial applications.},

   abstract = {Abductive logic programming offers a formalism to declaratively express and solve problems in areas such as diagnosis, planning, belief revision and hypothetical reasoning. Tabled logic programming offers a computational mechanism that provides a level of declarativity superior to that of Prolog, and which has supported successful applications in fields such as parsing, program analysis, and model checking. In this paper we show how to use tabled logic programming to evaluate queries to abductive frameworks with integrity constraints when these frameworks contain both default and explicit negation. The result is the ability to compute abduction over well-founded semantics with explicit negation and answer sets. Our approach consists of a transformation and an evaluation method. The transformation adjoins to each objective literal O in a program, an objective literal not(O) along with rules that ensure that not(O) will be true if and only if O is false. We call the resulting program a dual program. The evaluation method, ABDUAL, then operates on the dual program. ABDUAL is sound and complete for evaluating queries to abductive frameworks whose entailment method is based on either the well-founded semantics with explicit negation, or on answer sets. Further, ABDUAL is asymptotically as efficient as any known method for either class of problems. In addition, when abduction is not desired, ABDUAL operating on a dual program provides a novel tabling method for evaluating queries to ground extended programs whose complexity and termination properties are similar to those of the best tabling methods for the well-founded semantics. A publicly available meta-interpreter has been developed for ABDUAL using the XSB system.},

In ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial integration with constraint solving. This integration of constraint solving into abductive reasoning facilitates a general form of constructive abduction and enables the application of abduction to computationally demanding problems. The paper studies the formal declarative and operational semantics of the ACLP framework together with its application to various problems. The general characteristics of the computation of ACLP and of its application to problems are also discussed. Empirical results based on an implementation of the ACLP framework on top of the CLP language of ECLiPSe show that ACLP is computationally viable, with performance comparable to the underlying CLP framework on which it is built. In addition, our experiments show the natural ability for ACLP to accommodate easily and in a robust way new or changing requirements of the original problem. ACLP thus combines the advantages of modularity and flexibility of the high-level representation afforded by abduction together with the computational effectiveness of low-level specialised constraint solving.},

The whole process is, nevertheless, complex and takes the focus of thescientist's attention away from his/her research and towards solving the complexity associated with managing computing products. Moreover, as the research evolves, references to previous results and workflows are needed as source of provenance data. Based on these observations, we claim that in-silico experiments must be supported by a hypotheses data model that describes the elements involved in a scientific exploration and supports hypotheses assessment. Adopting a data perspective to represent hypotheses allow high-level references to experiments and provides support for hypotheses evolution.

Objective: To give practical and pragmatic recommendations for how to document AI research so that the results are reproducible. Method: Our analysis of the literature shows that AI publications fall short of providing enough documentation to facilitate reproducibility. Our suggested best practices are based on a framework for reproducibility and recommendations given for other disciplines. Results: We have made an author checklist based on our investigation and provided examples for how every item in the checklist can be documented. Conclusion: We encourage reviewers to use the suggested best practices and author checklist when reviewing submissions for AAAI publications and future AAAI conferences.</p>},

   abstract = {Increasingly, scientific breakthroughs will be powered by advanced computing capabilities that help researchers manipulate and explore massive datasets.

The speed at which any given scientific discipline advances will depend on how well its researchers collaborate with one another, and with technologists, in areas of eScience such as databases, workflow management, visualization, and cloud computing technologies.

In The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery, the collection of essays expands on the vision of pioneering computer scientist Jim Gray for a new, fourth paradigm of discovery based on data-intensive science and offers insights into how it can be fully realized.
Critical praise for The Fourth Paradigm
“The individual essays—and The Fourth Paradigm as a whole—give readers a glimpse of the horizon for 21st-century research and, at their best, a peek at what lies beyond. It’s a journey well worth taking.”
— James P. Collins
School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University

From the back cover
“The impact of Jim Gray’s thinking is continuing to get people to think in a new way about how data and software are redefining what it means to do science."
— Bill Gates, Chairman, Microsoft Corporation

“I often tell people working in eScience that they aren’t in this field because they are visionaries or super-intelligent—it’s because they care about science and they are alive now. It is about technology changing the world, and science taking advantage of it, to do more and do better.”
— Rhys Francis, Australian eResearch Infrastructure Council

“One of the greatest challenges for 21st-century science is how we respond to this new era of data-intensive science. This is recognized as a new paradigm beyond experimental and theoretical research and computer simulations of natural phenomena—one that requires new tools, techniques, and ways of working.”
— Douglas Kell, University of Manchester

“The contributing authors in this volume have done an extraordinary job of helping to refine an understanding of this new paradigm from a variety of disciplinary perspectives.”
— Gordon Bell, Microsoft Research

   abstract = {<p>A major goal of cognitive neuroscience is to delineate how brain systems give rise to mental function. Here we review the increasingly large role informatics-driven approaches are playing in such efforts. We begin by reviewing a number of challenges conventional neuroimaging approaches face in trying to delineate brain-cognition mappings—for example, the difficulty in establishing the specificity of postulated associations. Next, we demonstrate how these limitations can potentially be overcome using complementary approaches that emphasize large-scale analysis—including meta-analytic methods that synthesize hundreds or thousands of studies at a time; latent-variable approaches that seek to extract structure from data in a bottom-up manner; and predictive modeling approaches capable of quantitatively inferring mental states from patterns of brain activity. We highlight the underappreciated but critical role for formal cognitive ontologies in helping to clarify, refine, and test theories of brain and cognitive function. Finally, we conclude with a speculative discussion of what future informatics developments may hold for cognitive neuroscience.</p>},

We present then a detailed account based on Nayak's suggested algorithmic solution (the best available), which is dominated by computing transitive closure—bounded in time by O(|V|⋅|S|), where S(E,V) is the input system structure composed of a set E of equations over a set V of variables with number of variable appearances (density) |S|. We also comment on the potential of causal ordering for emerging applications in large-scale hypothesis management and analytics.},

   abstract = {With the ever-increasing adoption of machine learning for data analytics, maintaining a machine learning pipeline is becoming more complex as both the datasets and trained models evolve with time. In a collaborative environment, the changes and updates due to pipeline evolution often cause cumbersome coordination and maintenance work, raising the costs and making it hard to use. Existing solutions, unfortunately, do not address the version evolution problem, especially in a collaborative environment where non-linear version control semantics are necessary to isolate operations made by different user roles. The lack of version control semantics also incurs unnecessary storage consumption and lowers efficiency due to data duplication and repeated data pre-processing, which are avoidable.In this paper, we identify two main challenges that arise during the deployment of machine learning pipelines, and address them with the design of versioning for an end-to-end analytics system MLCask. The system supports multiple user roles with the ability to perform Git-like branching and merging operations in the context of the machine learning pipelines. We define and accelerate the metric-driven merge operation by pruning the pipeline search tree using reusable history records and pipeline compatibility information. Further, we design and implement the prioritized pipeline search, which gives preference to the pipelines that probably yield better performance. The effectiveness of MLCask is evaluated through an extensive study over several real-world deployment cases. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed merge operation is up to 7.8x faster and saves up to 11.9x storage space than the baseline method that does not utilize history records.},
